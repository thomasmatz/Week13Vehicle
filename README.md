# Week13Vehicle
This is the repository for the Week13 class inheritance project.
The first commit was only for the vehicle class.
I do not remember why we put the word const after a Getter.
I am going to review that before making the second commit.

It was not until the 7th commit on Nov 21, 2022 that the 
polymorphism property was demonstrated properly.
